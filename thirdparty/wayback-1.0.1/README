Wayback User-level versioned file system for Linux

Copyright 2004 by Brian Cornell

This program is distributed under the Gnu GPL. For information about copying
and distributing this program, see the file COPYING.

Installation:
-------------

Installing Wayback should be as easy as typing
  make
and then (as root)
  make install

If there are errors in the make process, first try to get FUSE to install
properly (see INSTALL in the fuse-1.1 directory). You will need a kernel source
tree that represents your current kernel.

Usage:
------

To mount a directory with versioning support type the command
	mount.wayback <source> <dest>
where <source> is the directory where files are actually stored and <dest> is
the directory where files will be accesed with versioning.

To unmount a versioned directory simply type
	umount <dest>
where <dest> is the directory where the files are accessed as above.

Known Limitations:
------------------
There are some known limitations to Wayback and the FUSE interface it uses:
 - Changing things in directories where versioning has been used without using
   versioning may cause version data to become corrupt. If a directory is to
   be used with versioning, never use it without versioning.
 - Version files can become very large if you use programs that truncate and
   then rewrite entire files.
